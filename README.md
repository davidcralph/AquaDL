# Aqua
A better way to download online media, fast and safe. Supports YouTube, Vimeo and more!

## Why?
As some of my followers may know, I work on a website called https://qtradio.moe. Downloading content is hell, you have to find the video, download it, get the metadata etc. Since this process is long and tedious I decided to make a cool site which would automate most of these steps so I can concentrate on improving the service, not trying to work around youtube-dl and trying to remember the commands. (less fun when your school blocks the services and you have to use unsafe virus websites with a vpn)

## Installation
### Requirements
* Git (optional)
* Node.js
### Commands
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/ohlookitsderpy/AquaDL/
cd AquaDL
yarn # Yes, I use Yarn. Yarn >>> NPM```
